# Title: Chess Zen Mode – Privacy Policy
# Effective date: 2025 - 09 - 19


## Overview
Chess Zen Mode is a Chrome extension that hides ratings, names/usernames, and profile pictures on Chess.com to reduce distractions.

## Data collection
We do not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal information.

We do not use analytics, cookies, or tracking.

No user data leaves your device.

## How the extension works
A content script runs only on https://www.chess.com/play/online/* and https://www.chess.com/game/*.

It modifies page elements locally (DOM/CSS) to hide identity-related UI.

The extension does not access browsing history, keystrokes, or other site data beyond these pages.

## Permissions & host access
No Chrome runtime permissions (e.g., tabs, storage, activeTab) are requested.

Host access is limited to the Chess.com game pages above to enable the UI changes.

## Network activity
The extension does not make network requests to third-party servers.

A static avatar image may be referenced from Chess.com’s CDN as page content; this is not user data collection.


## Changes
If the policy changes, we will update this page and version notes in the Chrome Web Store listing.
